    <h1>Roblox Game Analytics Tracker</h1>
    <p>
      This dashboard displays live analytics for the Roblox games you’ve
      configured in <code>config.js</code>.  Data is collected periodically
      and stored locally; the graphs below visualise the history of visits
      and concurrent players, along with the percentage growth between
      successive samples.
